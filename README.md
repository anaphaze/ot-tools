# ot-tools
A collection of tools for analysis of cellular cryo-ET data
Each script has its own set of dependencies, which are listed in the header for now.
To facilitate usage, place the scripts in your $PATH or /usr/local/bin. All scripts in this collection start with "ot-" so there's no mixup with similarly name scripts.
