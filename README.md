# ot-tools
A collection of scripts for analysis of cellular cryo-ET data.

Each script has its own set of dependencies, which are listed in the header for now.
The python scripts can be run from the shell and can be placed in your $PATH. Most of the scripts in this collection start with "ot_".

Examples of how these scripts are used can be found here: http://www.anaphase.org/papers

Thanks to the students who have written or tested these scripts.
